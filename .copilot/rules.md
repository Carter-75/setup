## Agent Operational Directives
- When deleting files, especially multiple files, do so one at a time to ensure success.
- Before executing deletion commands, verify you are using the correct syntax for Windows PowerShell.
- If a deletion command fails, you are to persistently try alternative commands and methods until the file is successfully deleted. You should only cease these attempts if I explicitly instruct you to stop via chat message.
